### Number Guessing Game
 - Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game!** This project was made during an Oasis Infobyte internship.
 - It helps people practice Java programming in a fun way. Players guess a number in a certain range and get feedback after each guess until they find the right number.
 - The main aims of this project are to show basic Java concepts like loops, if statements, and handling input. It also aims to make a game that is fun and easy to use.
 - This project is great for newbies wanting to get better at coding and for skilled programmers who want a quick, fun coding challenge.

### Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The game features an intuitive, console-based interface that guides the player through the guessing process, making it easy for users of all ages and skill levels to enjoy.
- **Random Number Generation:** Utilizes Java's `Random` class to generate a new number each time the game starts, ensuring a fresh and unpredictable experience with each playthrough.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user inputs valid numbers, providing clear error messages and instructions for invalid entries, which enhances the overall user experience and robustness of the game.
- **Win/Loss Feedback:** Provides immediate and clear feedback on whether the user's guess is too high, too low, or correct, allowing players to adjust their strategy and improve their guessing skills.

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file to begin.
2. **Make a Guess:** The game will prompt you to guess a number within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100).
3. **Receive Feedback:** Enter your guess and press Enter. The game will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Continue Guessing:** Keep guessing until you find the correct number. Use the feedback provided to narrow down your options.
5. **Win the Game:** Once you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and exit.
